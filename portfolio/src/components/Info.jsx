            <p>
            I am a third-year software engineering student from Finland who’s always looking for more information and skills to add to my toolbox. 
            I’ve always been a huge fan of electronics and software: anything from videogames to web design interests me greatly. 
            My current obsession is with different controller interfaces: touch screens, smart homes, knobs and sliders.<br/>
            <br/>
            I am currently studying in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences 
            for my Bachelor’s of Software Engineering and will graduate at the end of 2026. 
            Before that, I’m looking for an internship in software development or computer science areas.<br/>
