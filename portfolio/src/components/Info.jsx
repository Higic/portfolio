            <p>
            I am a third-year software engineering student from Helsinki, Finland who's always looking for more information and skills to add to my toolbox. 
            I've always been a huge fan of electronics and software: anything from videogames to web design interests me greatly. 
            My current obsession is with different controller interfaces: touch screens, smart homes, knobs and sliders.<br/>
            <br/>
            I am currently studying in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences 
            for my Bachelor's of Software Engineering and will graduate at the start of 2026.

            I have no problems working in stressful or rushed environments. My first Internship was at Airbus Helsinki's Lab Testing team. During my internship I learned about SCRUM in a real working environment.
            Most of my time was spent programming internal software for the team in Python. Other technologies included automated testing and scripts for different shells.<br/>
